When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    The most common use of remote repositories is when your collaborating with
 other people on a project.  You can also use them when you want to share your code
 with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So when you are working on code, it doesn't change without you expecting it. If their is a bug you can pull
    the change until you fix the bug.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks, clones, and branches are all ways to add new changes without
affecting any existing version of your project.  With branches the new changes are added in
the same repository.  Forking and cloning both copy an entire repository to
and bring it into a new location. I can use branches when I want to change something and keep the old version
If you want to work on a repository on your computer you can clone it.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  If you are about to go somewhere without wifi you can use the last known version on your computer.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

     When working with a large group
    using branches can help to keep track of which changes that have already been reviewed and
    approved.

    A master can be very helpful when wanting to change a huge part of the project and a branch can make small changes in a certain section.
